where centerImage contains the PIL.Image object of center image. 

iarray has the image objects of PIL.Image, but make sure the order is maintained. 

 

where 

First argument: 
I => use oriented feature discriptor
S => use SIFT features

We have implemented geometric transform that mimic cv2.wrapPerspective(), but we parameterized which one to use based on parameters. 

Second argument

O => use open cv transformation 
I => use implemented geometric transform

All the examples mentioned in the pdf are from "implemented geometric transform"

Third Argument

resize fraction 

range => 0.0 to 1.0 

Command 2: 

This the wrapper call for mymosaic. 

command: python3 wrapper2.py

update the array in iarray with new image objects. 

middle Image will the center image.
